# Specification: Secure Discovery Portal

## Goal
To implement a high-fidelity, secure client booking and lead capture ecosystem that aligns with the agency's technical-noir aesthetic.

## Requirements
- **Secure Lead Capture:** Implement a robust booking form with validation.
- **Cinematic Experience:** Form entry and submission should feature high-quality animations (Framer Motion).
- **Automated Notifications:** Integrity between form submission and agency notification (Email/Slack/Discord).
- **Privacy & Compliance:** Ensure secure handling of client data.
- **Technical Aesthetic:** The UI must maintain the "technical-noir" Geist-based look.

## User Flow
1. User navigates to the "Discovery" or "Join" portal.
2. User enters project details (Type, Budget, Scope, Timeline).
3. User receives a cinematic confirmation upon successful submission.
4. Agency receives an automated notification with full project logs.

## Performance
- 60fps target for form interactions.
- Optimized bundle size for the portal components.
