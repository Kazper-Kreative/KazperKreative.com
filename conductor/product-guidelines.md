# Product Guidelines: Kazper Kreative LLC

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone
- **Tone:** Enigmatic, Technical, and High-Stakes.
- **Messaging Style:** Use concise, punchy prose that leans into the Tech-Noir aesthetic. Avoid corporate jargon in favor of atmospheric, authoritative language that emphasizes precision and mastery.
- **Narrative:** Position the agency as a specialized strike team for high-fidelity engineering challenges.

## 2. Visual Identity & UX
- **Aesthetic:** High-contrast "Technical Noir." Deep blacks, vibrant functional accents (e.g., tech-purple, cyan), and aggressive play with light and shadow.
- **Interaction Philosophy:** Kinetic Storytelling. The interface should feel like a cinematic experience, utilizing scroll-triggered 3D scenes (R3F) and intentional motion effects to guide the user through the content.
- **Motion:** Use intentional motion-blur and parallax to create depth, but ensure it serves the narrative flow rather than being purely decorative.

## 3. Engineering & Performance Standards
- **Performance-First Immersion:** Despite the cinematic goals, the site must remain lightweight. Optimize assets aggressively and use procedural generation where possible to minimize initial load times.
- **Graceful Degradation:** The experience must be functional and visually compelling even without Three.js. Provide high-quality static fallbacks that maintain the brand's aesthetic.

## 4. Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Contrast:** Adhere to strict WCAG AA standards. Ensure critical information and navigation remain highly visible against the dark UI.
- **Reduced Motion:** Respect user system preferences for reduced motion. Provide an in-app toggle to disable or dampen kinetic 3D scenes and heavy animations.
- **Readability:** Maintain high legibility through careful typography (Geist Sans/Mono) and layout spacing, even within a dramatic visual environment.
