Graphics & Shader Developer
I’m a low-level game engine developer who lives close to the metal but ships comfortably inside modern engines.

My background is rooted in custom engine and framework development. I’ve built games using SDL3, and I’m currently developing a Vulkan-based game engine on top of the Windows API, with planned support for Linux and macOS. This means I understand not just how to use engines, but how they actually work under the hood: memory, rendering pipelines, threading, asset flow, and performance tradeoffs.

On top of that foundation, I work effectively inside Unreal Engine and Unity, particularly in areas where engine abstractions meet real hardware:

Shader development and optimization

Rendering and performance profiling

Bridging engine systems with low-level graphics concepts

Translating custom engine techniques into Unreal and Unity workflows

Because I understand graphics from Vulkan upward, I can diagnose performance problems that aren’t obvious from the editor alone and apply fixes that scale.

Alongside development, I offer QA and performance analysis services. I’ve worked with testing teams on:

Public projects such as Broken Aperture (on steam), focusing on performance improvements and in-depth analysis

My QA work is technical rather than surface-level. I specialize in:

Performance bottleneck identification

Frame-time and GPU/CPU analysis

Reproducible bug reports engineers can act on immediately

What You Get Working With Me

An engineer who understands engines from the inside out

Clean, well-reasoned technical decisions instead of guesswork

Performance-focused development and testing

Clear communication with developers, artists, and QA teams alike

If you need someone who can move fluidly between custom engines, Vulkan, Unreal, Unity, and real performance constraints, I’d be happy to talk.
